== ETF configuration

=== Data directory configuration

The deployment directory, in which the ETF web app is deployed by the web
application server, can not be used to store data because it is also deleted,
when the ETF web application is undeployed. Therefore a separate ETF data
directory is used.

The application determines the ETF data directory based on the operating system
in a specific order.

==== Windows

1. If the environment variable `ETF_WEBAPP_PROPERTIES_FILE` or the java
property `etf.webapp.properties.file` is set, the file will be used to
configure the etf directory.
2. If an etf-config.properties file exists in the 'etf' subfolder of the root
filesystems ('C:/etf', 'D:/etf', etc.), the file will be used to configure
the etf directory.
3. If a etf-config.properties file exists in the 'etf' subfolder of
the 'My Documents folder' (%DEFAULTUSERPROFILE%) on _Windows_, the file will
be used to configure the etf directory.
4. If on _Windows_ the etf-config.properties file exists in the
ProgramData folder ( %ALLUSERSPROFILE% ), the file will be used to configure
the etf directory.
5. If the etf-config.properties file is not found, a template configuration and
the default ETF data directory structure will be created in the ProgramData
folder ( %ALLUSERSPROFILE% ).

==== Linux

1. If the environment variable `ETF_WEBAPP_PROPERTIES_FILE` or the java
property `etf.webapp.properties.file` is set, the file will be used to
configure the etf directory.
2. If a `/etc/etf/etf-config.properties` file exists, the file will
be used to configure the etf data directory.
3. If an etf-config.properties file exists in the 'etf' subfolder of the root
filesystem ('/etf'), the file will be used to configure the etf directory.
4. If a etf-config.properties file exists in the home subfolder '~/.etf'
(note that the directory is hidden) on _Linux_, the file will be used to
configure the etf directory.
5. If the etf-config.properties file is not found, a template configuration and
the default ETF data directory structure will be created in the hidden home
subfolder '~/.etf'.

=== ETF data directory structure

This chapter describes the structure of the ETF data directory. The following
figure shows an example structure, identifiers or version numbers may be
different in your setup.

NOTE: When ETF is started from a docker image not all directories are mounted
on the host.

. The *bak* directory is used for internal backups.
anchor:etf-configuration-dir[ETF configuration file]
. The <<ETF-config-file>> is located in the *config* directory. Changes to
this file will only take effect after restarting the ETF.
. The *ds* directory is used for storing data and contains a *attachments*
subfolder for files that are downloaded or created during a Test Run.
In the *obj* folder XML representations of all framework items
(Executable Test Suites, Reports, etc.) are stored. These items are also stored
in a database that is saved in the *db/data/etf-ds* directory. Other databases
in the *db/data/* folder, are created during test runs to speed up test queries.
The *db/repo* folder contains extensions for the database.
. Files that are uploaded to the framework are temporary stored in the
*http_uploads* folder and afterwards moved to the *testdata* directory.
anchor:etf-log-file[ETF log file]
. The ETF log file location depends on whether the system environment
variables **CATALINA_HOME** or **TOMCAT_HOME** are set. If so the file is
stored in the *TOMCAT_HOME\logs* or *CATALINA_HOME\logs* directory. This is usually
the case when ETF is run from within a Tomcat application server. Otherwise the
log file can be found in the ETF data directory below the *logs* subfolder.
. Executable Test Suites must be installed in the *projects* folder.
They are automatically (re-)loaded after a short time.
. Testdrivers are loaded from the *td* directory on ETF startup.
. The *testdata* directory contains uploaded files. XML files are
indexed in databases in *db/data/etf-tdb-<UUID>* directories during a test run.

[TIP]
====
If you want to create backups of the ETF data directory, back up:

* config/etf-config.properties
* ds/obj
* logs/etf.log
