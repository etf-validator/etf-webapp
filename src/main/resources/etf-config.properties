# ETF CONFIGURATION PROPERTY FILE
#########################################
# By default all data are stored in the WEB-INF/etf
# subirectory. Because a undeployment of the application also
# deletes the complete directory it is recommended to create
# a data directory for the apllication for instance a /etf/data
# and to copy the contents of WEB-INF/etf into it.
# This property file should also be copied into that directory.
# The ETF WebApp uses by default the property file
# classes/etf-config.properties from the  application
# directory, which will also be delete on undeployment.
# It is also recommended to copy this file and to specify the
# path to the property file by setting a
# ETF_WEBAPP_PROPERTIES_FILE system variable.

# Version of the property file, used for backward compatibility.
# (do not modify unless you know what you are doing)
